### Nerd Stuff
I have not created or maintained a blog for at least 10 years. However, I do write a ton of documentation for both my work and personal life. Obsidian is my go to for documentation since I broke away from Confluence, but as for this blog I will run it on Docusaurus using CloudFlare workpages and GitHub as a solution for hosting some of my content to the world.

### The Goal (Acceptance Criteria) for blog
- Share with people whom are friends and family, but not exactly in communication everyday.
- Host some of my Documentation online so I can reference it out in the field.
- Ability to import my blog to another format. (Markdown is universal)
- Ability to view and host locally
    - Just clone ```git clone yourRepoHere``` and run command: ```npm start```

### New Years goals
- Dedicated Bible time everyday
- Dedicated Book reading time everyday
- Dedicated Exercise everyday
- Dedicated Project time everyday
- 8 cups of  water a day
