## Ministry


## Gardening
Well after looking at the cost of grocieries last year, I decided to become a farmer... sort of. I was however pulling weeds out in the garden beds about 2 hours after I did the math of food cost. Wouldn't you know it that many of the things that can normally handle Florida cold, died. Who knew it would snow in Florida. My beans I planted sure didn't.
