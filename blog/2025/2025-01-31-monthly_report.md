### Nerd Stuff
I have not created or maintained a blog for at least 10 years. However, I do write a ton of documentation for both my work and personal life. Obsidian is my go to for documentation since I broke away from Confluence, but as for this blog I will run it on Docusaurus using CloudFlare workpages and GitHub as a solution for hosting some of my content to the world.

### The Goal
- Share with people whom are friends and family, but not exactly in communication everyday.
- Host some of my Documentation online so I can reference it out in the field.
