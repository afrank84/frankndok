# About Me

Hi, I’m Frank, I am a follower of Christ and a passionate DevOps professional with a knack for creating streamlined solutions across various platforms and tools. I thrive in environments where I can blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving to deliver impactful results. My background spans software development, infrastructure automation, and containerized applications, making me well-versed in modern DevOps practices.

I enjoy building user-friendly applications, managing intricate databases, and designing scalable workflows. Whether it’s creating a plant management app tailored to the gardening community or automating complex tasks through custom scripts, I approach each project with a focus on efficiency, usability, and precision.

When I’m not coding or troubleshooting, you can find me experimenting with DIY setups on my Synology NAS, diving into gardening projects, or conceptualizing innovative ways to integrate tools like GitHub Actions with everyday workflows. I’m always on the lookout for the next challenge that allows me to combine my technical skills with my passion for building things that matter.

Also I was too lazy to write my own about me, so I had AI do it. Automation... I do a lot of automation. But I do approve of the above description.
