# Welcome

# Why this site exists
Hi, my name is Frank and this site is where I host documentation and my blog. The blog is for my family, friends, and others overseas where communitcation is difficult. While the documnetation is mostly for me when I travel so I can spin up a local blog when in remote places as everything is version controlled with Git.

# Who am I
I am many things, but first and foremost a follower of Christ. 

# Current Profession
I work within the realm of technology with things so nerdy that I typcially glaze over the eyes of professional nerds. I started my carear with webdesign/advertisng/marketing and moved over to DevOps. Currently I deal with a ton of automation/scripts/infrustructure stuff. However, very recently I have been semi forced into security to meet some needs where I work. Since I am a bit weaker on the network and security side I have decided to throw myself into that field for at least the year of 2025.

# Hobbies
Gardening, Hiking, and more Technology.
