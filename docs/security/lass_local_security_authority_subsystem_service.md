# lass.exe - Local Security Authority Subsystem Service

`lsass.exe` stands for **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service**. It is a critical process in the Windows operating system responsible for enforcing security policies and handling various authentication-related tasks.

### What Does `lsass.exe` Do?
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Handles logins and verifies user credentials by interacting with the Active Directory or local security policies.
   - It checks the username and password entered against stored information to allow or deny access.

2. **Enforces Security Policies**:
   - Implements local and domain-wide security policies, such as password policies, user permissions, and account lockout thresholds.

3. **Token Creation**:
   - Generates security tokens for users after successful authentication. These tokens contain the user's permissions and are used for accessing resources.

4. **Auditing and Logging**:
   - Records security events in the Windows Security Event Log. This includes login attempts, password changes, and other security-related activities.

5. **Handles SSO (Single Sign-On)**:
   - Facilitates Single Sign-On for domain-joined devices by managing authentication for resources on the same network.

2. Scanning it with antivirus software.

### Related Security Concerns
1. **Password Dumping**:
   - Attackers may target `lsass.exe` to dump credentials using tools like `Mimikatz`. This is often part of **privilege escalation** in cyber-attacks.
   - Mitigation involves using Windows Defender Credential Guard or restricting access to `lsass.exe`.

2. **High CPU Usage**:
